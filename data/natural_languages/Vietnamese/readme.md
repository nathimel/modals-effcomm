Some notes about two forms of _được_:

_Được1_ is a benefactive or permissive preverbal particle, and occurs in deontic contexts. 

_Được2_ is an ability-modal particle that occurs either in postverbal or clause-final position, scoping either over the verb or the matrix clause, and does not occur in deontic contexts.
