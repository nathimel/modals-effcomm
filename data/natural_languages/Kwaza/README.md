# Other Notes

There are several expressions that the author categorizes as modal but don't behave like modals

-le  : describes as 'frustrative' (433), and translates to 'for the time being', not sure if it should be a modal

-tara- : describes as 'procrastinative' (434), translate as 'will do something later', indicates an action or event is postponed, not sure if it should be a modal

-niÌƒ : desribed as 'causational' (401), translate to 'make someone do something', not sure if it should be a modal

-tsy-: does not qualify for weak,epistemi even though one example in 609 translates to 'may'
