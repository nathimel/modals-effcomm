6.29.22: incomplete looking plot

The high informativity, low communicative cost languages don't seem to be getting explored after some updates, most recently to altk's optimization and agent modules. The space used to be fully explored. I have seen this problem before too. 
Tried:
    Looking into AddPoint:
    - uncommenting AddPoint() as a mutation to increase informativity, because at some point previously it wasn't helping -- presumably because high informativity space was getting explored fine.
    - looking into how informativity is measured in AddPoint. This doesn't matter so much as long as informativity isn't already recorded as 1.0, because it just searches the language for a point not yet covered, and then adds an expression to cover exactly that point.
    - running optimization with only AddPoint as a mutation, but this doesn't work because apparently you need all mutations in order for there to be a possible mutation when sample_mutate() is called.

    Looking into the history of some of the plots on github:
    - Looks like I had a similar issue when testing out various mutations, and found that RemovePoint was the culprit; apparently removing it as a possible mutation allowed the high informativity space to be explored. But it's possible that this wasn't the only cause, or at least something else may have motivated me to keep RemovePoint, because it still exists in the codebase.
        - Sure enough, commenting it out didn't improve on dev setting or a full run on indicator_literal. 

6.29.22: random seed not producing deterministic behavior

I have never seen deterministic behavior yet, but making the entry now. All scripts call the set_seed() function, which updates the only two libraries I know of that I'm using that use randomness:
    - random
    - numpy

7.1.22: pandas datatype confusion seems to not be a problem anymore. 

I'm not particularly worried about removing the logic which prevented floats from being read as strings, because the statistics and data look the same with and without. For reference though, pandas was once confused about there being mixed data types and I had to us pd.to_numeric() to convert all the appropriate columns back to floats.

7.1.22: strange plot with correct data but huge complexity limit at like 3e10

This happened once right after deleting altk's complexity module for refactoring, but then I haven't been able to reproduce again.
