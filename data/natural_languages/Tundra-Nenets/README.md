# Additional Notes for Tundra-Nenets

The book put modality under mood section, here are the mood markers that does not count as modals in our analysis:

imperative construction (86)

-xə: hortative for first person, oftern translates to 'let us/let me' (87)

-ya: categorized as 'optative' or 'jussive' that only occurs in third person, often translates to 'let'(88)

-rəwa: categorized as 'apprehensive' and means 'fear about the future'  or 'regret about past'(90)

-rəxamiə: categorized as 'reportative' (96), the difference between this expression and the inferential is that the speaker is less certain in reportative. not put under modality since the mood has more to do with evidentials

-wed (various form depending on person) : categorized as inferential and the examples are more epistemic but 93 says the expression combined with future tense express deontic modality. The deontic modality might be implied from context, so we did not put 'deontic' as one of the flaovr

-yi : categorized as subjunctive mood, p89 indicates that the expression in past tense can express irrealis possiblity

-n(')aqxiə/-meəqxiə: categorized as probablitiative(99) and the expression differ with respect to tense
